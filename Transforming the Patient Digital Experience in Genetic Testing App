# Case Study: Transforming the Patient Digital Experience in Genetic Testing App

## Project Overview
**Duration:** 3 Months  
**Role:** Lead UX Researcher  
**Focus:** Enhance the **digital experience** for patients undergoing genetic testing — from initial sign-up to receiving results.

The patient journey was fragmented, with unclear digital touchpoints, confusing instructions, and a lack of transparency during waiting periods. This led to high dropout rates, increased anxiety, and repeated support requests.

---

## My Role
- **Planned and executed** patient-focused UX research across **digital channels** (patient portal, onboarding flow, notifications).
- **Applied mixed methods** — usability testing, remote interviews, surveys, and analytics review — to uncover core experience gaps.
- **Synthesized** UX insights with web analytics and market benchmarks to prioritize improvements.
- **Collaborated** with product managers, designers, and engineering teams to implement changes directly into the digital roadmap.

## Research Approach

### 1. Discovery
- **Patient interviews** (n=15) to map digital journey expectations.
- **Survey** (n=120, 72% response rate) to quantify pain points in portal usage and onboarding.
- **Analytics review** revealed a **40% drop-off** during account creation.

### 2. Evaluation
- **Usability testing** (8 participants) on the current patient portal.
  - Found that 65% of patients could not locate their test status without assistance.
- **Content review** of onboarding emails and result notifications for clarity and tone.

### 3. Synthesis
- Built a **CX Journey Map** for the digital patient experience, highlighting:
  - Confusion during onboarding
  - Lack of proactive status updates
  - Unclear next steps post-results

---

## Key Findings
1. **Onboarding Drop-off**
   - Account creation form too long, lacking progress indicators.
2. **Status Tracking Gaps**
   - Patients unsure when results would be ready; no real-time updates.
3. **Tone & Accessibility**
   - Medical jargon and inconsistent tone created anxiety.

---

## Solutions Implemented
- **Simplified onboarding**: Reduced steps from 6 to 3, added a progress bar → **Drop-off decreased by 35%**.
- **Real-time test tracker**: Added visual progress stages (“Sample Received,” “In Analysis,” “Results Ready”) → **Support tickets for status inquiries dropped by 40%**.
- **Proactive notifications**: Email + SMS updates for key milestones → **Patient satisfaction scores increased by 25%**.
- **Plain language rewrite**: Adjusted portal copy and results summaries for better accessibility.
