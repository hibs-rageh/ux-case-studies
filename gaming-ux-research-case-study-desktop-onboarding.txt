# Gaming UX Research – Desktop Strategy Game

## Executive Summary
Redesigned the onboarding experience for a real-time strategy (RTS) desktop game.  
Led full-cycle UX research and prototyping using Lovable, resulting in measurable retention and engagement gains.

## Context
60% of new users were abandoning the game within the first 15 minutes.  
This project focused on optimizing the onboarding flow to reduce early drop-off and align experience with diverse gamer motivations across English and Arabic-speaking markets.

## Goals
- Increase tutorial completion rate  
- Improve Day 7 retention across EN and AR segments  
- Reduce onboarding-related support tickets  
- Localize onboarding flow to cultural expectations  

## Methodology
- Stakeholder interviews and alignment _(Miro)_  
- In-depth user interviews with screen recording _(OBS Studio)_  
- Behavioral heatmap analysis _(Hotjar)_  
- Usability testing with two prototype versions _(Lovable)_  
- A/B testing in live environment _(Firebase)_

## Findings

### Friction Point 1: Tooltip blindness and modal fatigue
- Users skipped guidance due to pop-up overload  
- **Solution**: Introduced voice-guided contextual onboarding  

### Friction Point 2: UI overload and cognitive fatigue
- Over 20 visible elements in the first session screen  
- **Solution**: Reduced visible elements and introduced progressive disclosure  

### Friction Point 3: Cultural mismatch in Arabic onboarding
- Preference for audio and slower tutorial pacing  
- **Solution**: Fully localized onboarding with Arabic voiceover  

## Results
- ✅ +42% tutorial completion  
- ✅ +23% Day 7 retention  
- ✅ -35% onboarding support tickets  
- ✅ +28% mission flow completion  

## Impact
- Increased lifetime value and retention across regions  
- Scalable onboarding system created for future game launches  
- UX playbook and research artifacts reused by Product and Growth teams
