## 🔬 Research Strategy & Methodology

**Research Questions**
1. Where are friction points in the tutorial?
2. What motivates Arabic vs. English players?
3. How much autonomy vs. guidance do players prefer?
4. Which onboarding elements drive retention?

### Mixed-Methods Approach

#### 1. Stakeholder Alignment
- Interviews & collaborative mapping (Miro, Zoom)
- Output: Assumption map, success metrics, research charter

#### 2. Exploratory User Interviews
- 24 participants (EN & AR), screen-recorded 90-min sessions
- Tools: OBS, Notion, Calendly
- Thematic + behavioral + cultural analysis

#### 3. Behavioral Analytics
- 1,200+ Hotjar sessions, click tracking, scroll analysis
- Heatmaps + funnel drop-offs

#### 4. Prototype Testing
- Lovable prototypes A/B tested via Maze
- 32 participants tested two versions
- Usability metrics + SUS + interviews

#### 5. A/B Testing (Live)
- 5,000 users per variant via Firebase & Google Analytics
- Metrics: Tutorial completion, retention, first-action time
