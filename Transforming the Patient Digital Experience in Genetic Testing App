# 🩺 Case Study: Transforming the Patient Digital Experience in Genetic Testing

---

## 📌 Project Overview
**Duration:** 3 Months  
**Role:** Lead UX Researcher  
**Focus:** Enhance the **digital experience** for patients undergoing genetic testing — from initial sign-up to receiving results.

> The patient journey was fragmented, with unclear digital touchpoints, confusing instructions, and a lack of transparency during waiting periods. This led to high dropout rates, increased anxiety, and repeated support requests.

---

## 🎯 My Role
- **Planned and executed** patient-focused UX research across **digital channels** (patient portal, onboarding flow, notifications).  
- **Applied mixed methods** — usability testing, remote interviews, surveys, and analytics review — to uncover core experience gaps.  
- **Synthesized** UX insights with web analytics and market benchmarks to prioritize improvements.  
- **Collaborated** with product managers, designers, and engineers to integrate solutions into the product roadmap.

## 🔍 Research Approach

### **1. Discovery**
- **15 patient interviews** to map expectations and emotional states.  
- **Survey** (n=120, 72% response rate) to quantify portal usage pain points.  
- **Analytics review** revealed a **40% drop-off** during account creation.

### **2. Evaluation**
- **Usability testing** (8 participants) revealed that **65% of patients** couldn’t locate their test status without help.  
- **Content audit** of onboarding emails and results notifications for clarity and tone.

### **3. Synthesis**
- Created a **CX Journey Map** for the patient’s digital experience:
  - Confusion during onboarding  
  - Lack of proactive status updates  
  - Unclear next steps post-results
