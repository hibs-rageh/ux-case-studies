I’m a **Senior Service Designer & UX Research Strategist** with over 8 years of experience in healthcare, human factors, fintech, and service innovation.  
I bring a unique combination of:

- **Service Design Expertise**: Multi-region blueprinting, process optimization, adoption strategy.  
- **Healthcare & Clinical Workflow Knowledge**: Triage, imaging, lab testing, patient journey optimization.  
- **Business Intelligence Integration**: Translating operational metrics into actionable AI use cases.  
- **Research Leadership**: Stakeholder facilitation, human factors studies, cross-functional alignment.  

---

## The Ask

The client wanted to **identify and prioritize AI opportunities** to improve operational efficiency, clinical outcomes, and patient experiences across multiple countries.

**Scope:**
- Understanding distributed clinical workflows.
- Aligning multiple stakeholders (call centers, clinical teams, service providers, technical teams).
- Delivering a roadmap of AI scenarios with both **unique opportunities** and **enhancements**.
- Producing **technical briefs** ready for development teams.

---

## Business Requirements

AI use cases needed to:
- Integrate into existing EMR and operational systems.
- Deliver measurable impact on KPIs: SLA compliance, triage speed, no-show rates, patient throughput.
- Adapt to regional workflow and regulatory variations.
- Be backed by service design mapping and BI validation.

---

## Onboarding

Preparation included:
- Reviewing transformation strategy, previous AI initiatives, and lessons learned.
- Accessing operational process documentation, BI dashboards, and EMR usage logs.
- Mapping stakeholders across internal (call center managers, clinical leads, BI analysts) and external (vendors, service providers, insurance coordinators) groups.
- Setting up collaboration tools: **Miro** (blueprinting), **Teams/Zoom** (workshops), **Confluence** (documentation).
- Defining success criteria: measurable operational gains, improved patient flow, high adoption rates.

## Approach & Methodology

The project followed a **service design-driven, BI-informed** approach across three phases:

### **Phase 1 – Discovery & Workflow Mapping**
- **Goal:** Understand workflows, regional variations, and pain points.
- **Methods:** Service blueprinting, process mapping, human factors observation.
- **Key Findings:**
  - Escalation workflows inconsistent and heavily manual.
  - Outdated partner service provider capacity data.
  - Delayed after-hours urgent case handling.
  - No framework for redistributing workload across time zones.

---

### **Phase 2 – AI Opportunity Identification & Scoring**
- **Goal:** Prioritize AI opportunities based on Impact–Feasibility–Readiness (IFR) scoring.
- **Methods:** IFR scoring, BI metric analysis.
- **High-scoring Unique Opportunities:**
  - Cross-Time-Zone Urgency Escalation Orchestration.
  - Service Provider Capacity Forecasting.
- **High-scoring Enhancements:**
  - Intelligent Triage Prioritization.
  - Appointment Scheduling Optimization.

---

### **Phase 3 – Technical Brief Development**
- **Goal:** Translate scenarios into developer-ready documentation.
- **Methods:** Structured briefs (context → requirements → KPIs → delivery plan).
- **Outputs:** 20 AI scenarios – 10 unique, 10 enhancements.

## Technical Brief Example 1 – Cross-Time-Zone Urgency Escalation Orchestration

**Context:**  
Urgent cases logged outside local hours faced delays in critical categories (diagnostics, emergency referrals, post-op complications).

**Objective:**  
AI escalation to detect urgent after-hours cases and reassign them to available qualified clinicians in other time zones within 1 hour.

**KPIs:**
- +20% urgent cases handled within 1 hour  
- -25% average resolution time  
- ≥80% acceptance of AI-assigned cases without override

## Technical Brief Example 2 – Service Provider Capacity Forecast for Contract Performance
<img width="1024" height="1536" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdabd74b-6896-4c83-9b1b-f08161f1e37f" />


**Context:**  
Service providers breached SLAs during predictable seasonal peaks due to volume surges.

**Objective:**  
AI forecasting to predict capacity risks up to 4 weeks ahead, enabling proactive redistribution.

**KPIs:**
- SLA breach rate ≤5% during peaks  
- ≥15% proactive reallocations before breach  
- Partner satisfaction ≥4.0/5

---

## Challenges & Troubleshooting

- **Data Gaps:** Resolved via BI cross-verification.  
- **Resistance to Change:** Used service blueprint visuals to minimize workflow disruption concerns.  
- **Regional Variation:** Built configurable AI logic per hub.

---

## Learnings

- Service design artifacts are critical for multi-stakeholder alignment.  
- Early BI validation prevents wasted AI development cycles.  
- Clinical terminology standardization is essential for multi-region AI adoption.
